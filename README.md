## About

This repository is primarily for my personal learning and exploration of PyTorch. I will be adding new projects and experiments as I progress.  The aim is to solidify my understanding of deep learning concepts and gain practical experience with PyTorch.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the following installed:

* **Python:** Python 3.7 or higher is recommended.
* **PyTorch:** You can install PyTorch using pip: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio` (adjust the command according to your CUDA availability and operating system).  Consult the official PyTorch website for detailed installation instructions: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
* **Other dependencies:**  Each project might have its own specific dependencies. Refer to the individual project folders for their respective requirements files (e.g., `requirements.txt`) and install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository (This list will be updated as new projects are added):

* **Project 1: [Add soon]** (Folder: `[Add soon]`)
    * Brief description of the project.
    * Key features and functionalities.
* **Project 2: [Add soon]** (Folder: `[Add soon]`)
    * Brief description of the project.
    * Key features and functionalities.

**Accessing Project-Specific Information:** Navigate to the individual project folders for more detailed explanations, instructions, and results. Each project folder should contain its own README file with further details.


## Resources

These are some of the resources I've found helpful in my PyTorch learning journey:

* **PyTorch Official Tutorials:** [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
* **Deep Learning with PyTorch:** [A book by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann](https://pytorch.org/deep-learning-with-pytorch/)
